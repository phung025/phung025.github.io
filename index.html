         <h5>Research Projects</h5>
         <p>My research focuses on machine learning, artificial intelligence, advance data structures & algorithms, programming languages, and software engineering. I am currently working on the weight shifting research project with Dr. Arshia Khan.</p>
         <div class="list-box">
            <h6> Weight Shifting </h6>
            <p>I worked with Dr. Arshia Khan from University of Minnesota Duluth to build a system consists of an iOS mobile application, a Raspberry PI, and a pressure mapping mattress that targets wheelchair-bound patients to help prevent pressure ulcers and study the correlation between the development of decubitus ulcers and sitting duration.</p>

            <h6> Medication Management for Patients after Open-heart Surgery </h6>
            <p>I worked with Dr. Arshia Khan from UMD to develop an application that helps patients recently recovered from open-heart surgery to manage their medications through the help of remote doctor consultation. The application is a part of the research project on health care management for patients after open-heart surgery.</p>

         <h5>Other Works</h5>
         <p>Besides the main research interests, I also spend my free time writing softwares and having fun with programming. Here are some personal projects and class projects I have done.</p>
         <div class="list-box">
            <h6>rdap</h6>
            <p>rdap - Racket data analysis package. This package is inspired by the Python

            </p>
            <h6>Dots and Boxes AI with Reinforcement Learning</h6>
            <p>This is a class project for the course CS 5751 - Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining. The objective of this project is to build an agent that can play the game dots and boxes with a decent level. In the project, we buit several agents using different RL algorithms including TD-0 Learning and Q-Learning. <br>

            <h6>Building Predictive Model for Weather Prediction in Szeged, Hungary</h6>
            <p>This is a class project for the course STAT 5511 - Regression Analysis. Our project studies the relationship between temperature and other factors such as humidity, wind speed, pressure, visibility, date, etc by building predictive models. The project uses regression analysis (SLR and MLR) and classification analysis (KNN and Random Forest). <br>
