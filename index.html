The target algorithm for the study is a density-based outlier detection algorithm called Orion from research papers at University of Oklahoma. Orion uses evolutionary computation and clustering algorithm to detect anomalies within a dataset. We conducted performance analysis of Orion against several distance-based outlier detection algorithms like Abstract-C, MCOD, and Approximate-Storm. We also developed and implemented new optimization solutions for Orion to reduce execution time in the evolutionary computation process.</p><div></div><div><h6>Presentations</h6><div><p>Phung, N.

A Raspberry PI 3 computer connects the mattress and retrieves the data through a USB port using a Python script. The Raspberry PI acts as a peripheral device and transfer the data back to the iOS device using its built-in Bluetooth 4.0 module. The iOS app uses the CoreBluetooth framework to receive the data and uses it to visualize the real-time pressure mapping of users' buttocks area. The mobile app uses the data as input for a threshold-based algorithm to automatically detect weight shifting.</p><div><h6>Papers</h6><div><p>Khan, A., Reuter, M., Phung, N.
